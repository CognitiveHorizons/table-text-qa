{'answer-text': 'British', 'context': "Pos is 6 . No is 4 . Driver is Ralf Schumacher . Constructor is Williams - BMW . Time is 1:11.106 . Gap is +0.883 . Ralf Schumacher ( born 30 June 1975 ) is a German former racing driver . He is the younger brother of seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher and the pair are the only siblings to win Formula One races . Schumacher began karting at the age of three and achieved early success before making the transition to automobile racing in the German Formula Three Championship and the Formula Nippon series . He first drove in Formula One with Jordan Grand Prix for the 1997 season . Schumacher moved to the Williams F1 team in 1999 , finishing sixth in the Drivers ' Championship that year . He won his first Grand Prix in 2001 , en route to fourth place in the Drivers ' Championship , and subsequently won five more races over the course of two years . Schumacher left Williams at the end of 2004 and joined Toyota Racing in 2005 . However , his performance throughout 2006 and 2007 resulted in Schumacher leaving Formula One , as a result of internal pressure . After leaving Formula One , Schumacher joined the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters in 2008 , achieving minor success , and retired from motorsport at the end of 2012 to enter a managerial role within DTM , mentoring young drivers . Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited , currently racing in Formula One as ROKiT Williams Racing , is a British Formula One motor racing team and constructor . It was founded by team owner Sir Frank Williams and automotive engineer Sir Patrick Head . It is still run by Williams . The team was formed in 1977 after Frank Williams 's two earlier unsuccessful F1 operations : Frank Williams Racing Cars ( 1969 to 1975 ) and Wolf-Williams Racing ( 1976 ) . All of Williams F1 chassis are called FW then a number , the FW being the initials of team owner , Frank Williams . The team 's first race was the 1977 Spanish Grand Prix , where the new team ran a March chassis for Patrick Nève . Williams started manufacturing its own cars the following year , and Switzerland 's Clay Regazzoni won Williams 's first race at the 1979 British Grand Prix . At the 1997 British Grand Prix , Canadian Jacques Villeneuve scored the team 's 100th race victory , making Williams one of only four teams in Formula One , alongside Ferrari , fellow British team McLaren , and Mercedes to win 100 races . Williams won nine Constructors ' Championships between 1980 and 1997 . This stood as a record until Ferrari surpassed it in 2000 . Drivers for Williams have included Australia 's Alan Jones ; Finland 's Keke Rosberg ; Britain 's Nigel Mansell , Damon Hill and Jenson Button ; France 's Alain Prost ; Brazil 's Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna ; and Canada 's Jacques Villeneuve . Each of these drivers , with the exception of Senna and Button , have captured one Drivers ' title with the team . BMW has been involved in Formula One in a number of capacities since the inauguration of the World Drivers ' Championship in 1950 . The company entered occasional races in the 1950s and 1960s ( often under Formula Two regulations ) , before building the BMW M12/13 inline-four turbocharged engine in the 1980s . This engine was the result of a deal between BMW and Brabham , which resulted in the team 's chassis being powered by BMW engines from 1982 until 1987 , a period in which Nelson Piquet won the 1983 championship driving a Brabham BT52-BMW . BMW also supplied the M12/13 on a customer basis to the ATS , Arrows , Benetton and Ligier teams during this period , with various degrees of success . In 1988 , Brabham temporarily withdrew from the sport and BMW withdrew its official backing from the engines , which were still used by the Arrows team under the Megatron badge . Turbocharged engines were banned by the revised Formula One Technical Regulations for 1989 , rendering the M12/13 obsolete . BMW decided to return to Formula One in the late 1990s by signing an exclusive contract with the Williams team , which needed a new long-term engine supplier after the withdrawal of Renault in 1997 . The programme resulted in the creation of a new V10 engine which made its race début in the Williams FW22 in 2000 . The following year saw the partnership move from the midfield to challenging for race victories , but the desired championship remained elusive due to the dominance of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari in the first half of the 2000s . By 2005 , the relationship between BMW and Williams had deteriorated , and BMW chose to part company and buy the rival Sauber team outright . The BMW Sauber project lasted from 2006 until 2009 , and resulted in a substantial increase in competitiveness for the Swiss former privateer team . Two podium finishes in the first year were followed by a solid third in the Constructors ' Championship in 2007 ( which became second when McLaren was disqualified ) .", 'title': '2004 United States Grand Prix 0', 'question': 'The driver who finished in position 4 in the 2004 United States Grand Prix was of what nationality ?', 'question_id': '0035c791af3d9666_3', 'is_impossible': False, 'answers': [{'answer_start': 1423, 'text': 'British'}], 'pred': 'German'}
